# middleengine-website-comments

This is the source code for the Middle Engine Web site Octomments back-end. [Octomments](https://github.com/krasimir/octomments) is a comments plug-in that is implemented using GitHub Issues. One way of using it is to deploy your own back-end to better deal with the GitHub API's rate limiting. This repository is that back-end source code.
